Kerbal Engineer Redux is **not** required. We use our own modified version of KER's vessel simulator, embedded in the main DLL.

## Known limitations

- Diameter auto-sizing assumes you orient the parts normally; it will not work properly if you flip them upside down before attaching them.
- I have not tested with Real Fuels or other parts of Realism Overhaul. I've tried to do things generically wherever possible, so it might work, but it might not.
- I have no idea whether it works well with career mode.

## Future plans

See [TODO.md](TODO.md).
