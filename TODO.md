# TODO

## Release bookkeeping

- [ ] Forum signature banner

## Fixes

- [ ] Freeze on re-root
- [ ] Attached parts rendered with offset from joint in some symmetry configurations
- [ ] Update texture in parts list when default changes
- [ ] Update simulator to drop non-connected drop tanks immediately
- [ ] Figure out why the Vens textures have alpha channel in settings

## Auto size more procedural parts

- [ ] Solid fuel
- [ ] Xenon / Electric Charge
- [ ] Monopropellant
- [ ] Fueled nosecones

## More sophisticated logic

- [ ] Determine atmospheric programmatically based on engine or time after launch
- [ ] Multiple texture defaults based on dimensions (small, medium, large)
- [ ] Option to size for a target delta V

## Code style

- [ ] Abstract out KER simulator into standalone DLL w/ callbacks
